# 🏗️ Scraping
I thought when I made this maybe the web would take a turn and scraping might die off.

The use of APIs makes data so much smaller and efficient. 

However, public APIs are now a thing of the past.

Ok, well what about authenticated private APIs?

Programmatic access in general is seen as fueling competetive models of generating income for the source company.

So, scraping becomes the solution for hacking together data outside confines of official apps.

# 🦫 Rewritten
I have rewriten the scraper and its companion Discord bot in Golang

Both are now located in the [AWS](https://github.com/CodaBool/AWS) repo as scraper and discord modules.
